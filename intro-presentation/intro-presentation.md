# Software development is social

- Software is built collaboratively
- GitHub is a platform for "social coding"
- GitHub users collaborate on many tasks:
    - reporting bugs
    - discussing future changes
    - reviewing code quality

# Programming languages create communities

- Each project has a primary language
- Same language? Same habits & customs
- Language communities accumulate stereotypes
    - C, C++? \(\to\) "old-school"
    - JavaScript, Ruby? \(\to\) "hip"
    - SML, Haskell? \(\to\) "academic"

# GitHub has been studied extensively

- Which projects and languages are popular?
- Which languages are used frequently?
- Using "interest graphs" to gauge which topics are
  interesting
- How does transparency affect software development?

# We wish to answer:

\Large{How does social activity on GitHub vary by
programming language community?}

#

\Large{Along the way, we'll look at questions like these...}

#

- Which emojis are most common in this community?
- Are emoji reactions on threads common?
- Are there vernacular trends (acronyms, abbreviation,
  phrasings) in this community?

#

- Which other language communities does this community talk
  about?

#

- Is this community characterized by
    - a low number of frequently active contributors?
    - a high number of infrequently active contributors?
    - something in between?

#

- Do projects in this community have
    - more pull requests than issues?
    - more things closed than open?
- Are discussions resolved quickly, or do they drag on?

#

- Are contributions primarily
    - during the day?
    - in the evening?
    - late at night?

# Beyond "just measuring popularity"

- Look at projects in each community which have **comparable
  numbers of stars** (stratify)
- Sample "canonical representatives" of a language community

# Presenting our findings

- Visualize a handful of the answers to these questions
- Critically analyze our findings

# Who cares?

- Maintainers of large open source projects
    - Trying to ensure positive community for large number
      of people
- Hobbyist programmers
    - Trying to deliver small- to medium-sized product for
      specific group
- People looking to join a new community
    - Want to understand how that community is different
      from ones they're familiar with

# What could go wrong?

- Hard to find good data
- Data gives no "interesting" insights
- Visualizations don't communicate findings well

# Deliverables

- Midterm
    - Interview for people's preconceptions of GitHub
    - Sample dataset representative of final dataset
    - Initial prototypes of visualization graphics
- Final
    - Analysis based on larger dataset
    - Have graphics visualizing data and our analysis
